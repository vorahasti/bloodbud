# Bloodbud
In underdeveloped countries, established supplies are limited and donors usually donate blood when their family or friends need a transfusion. Many donors donate as an act of charity, but in countries that allow paid donation some donors are paid. This project has been chosen to meet the requirements of blood banks and common people to reach out to blood quickly. As compared to the existing system our project provides an application which is simpler, easy and convenient.Users with an active internet connection can use our system to search for a donor belonging to the required blood group and the nearest userâ€™s information will pop up on the screen. Further the only job is to search for the user , contact him and get hold of the blood, thus saving the time that could have been wasted in searching the entire blood bank and the associates of the legible blood group
